I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>'s <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> . I am part of the <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/">Viterbi School of Engineering</a> and I work under the advisement of <a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/">Professor Yan Liu</a>. 
I'm mostly interested in principled methods for machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on deepfakes / forgery detection and interpretable methods for understanding and building deep networks.
<br><br>
Before USC, I spent five wonderful years at <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, graduating in May 2019 with my Bachelor's (2018) and Master's degree (2019) in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>. At MIT, I was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to work with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/">Professor Aleksander Madry</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/">Professor Leslie P. Kaelbling</a>.

This space is currently a work in progress! For now, I encourage you to seek out my <a href="https://lqtrinh.com/blog">blog</a>, a space devoted to my current PhD journey and interests: Machine Learning, Image Generations and Manipulations, and (occasionally) Snowboarding.
