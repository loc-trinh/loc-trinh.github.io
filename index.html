I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Southern California. I am part of the Viterbi School of Engineering and I work under the advisement of Professor Yan Liu. 
I'm mostly interested in principled methods for machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on forgery detection and interpretable methods for understanding deep networks.

Before USC, I spent five wonderful years at MIT, graduating in May 2019 with my Bachelor's (2018) and Master's degree (2019) in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. At MIT, I was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to work with Professor Aleksander Madry and Professor Leslie P. Kaelbling.

This space is currently a work in progress! For now, I encourage you to seek out my blog, a space devoted to my current PhD journey and interests: Machine Learning, Image Generations and Manipulations, and (occasionally) Snowboarding.
